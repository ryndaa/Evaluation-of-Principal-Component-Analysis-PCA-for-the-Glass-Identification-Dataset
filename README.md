Project Outcomes:
- Analyzed the dataset with reduction features from 9 to 2
- The analysis revealed that PCA was less effective for this dataset because only 50.68% of the information was retained after dimensionality reduction. PCA is typically more effective for datasets with thousands of features, where dimensionality reduction is more beneficial
